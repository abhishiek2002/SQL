# Understanding Joins through Hotel Reservation System

You are managing the database for a hotel reservation system. The system tracks hotel guests, room bookings, and hotel staff. The database consists of the following tables:

    Guests Table: Stores guest details, including guest ID, name, and contact information.
    Rooms Table: Stores room details, including room ID, type of room, and price.
    Reservations Table: Stores details about room bookings, including reservation ID, guest ID, room ID, and reservation date.
    Staff Table: Stores details of the hotel staff, including staff ID, name, and position.

## Deliverables:

Retrieve a list of all guests and the room type they reserved, even if a guest hasnâ€™t made a reservation yet.

### Sample Input:

Guests Table:

GuestID|Name|Contact

    1|John Doe|john.doe@gmail.com

    2|Mary Jane|mary.jane@yahoo.com

    3|James Smith|james.smith@outlook.com

Rooms Table:

RoomID|RoomType|Price

    1|Single|100

    2|Double|150

    3|Suite|300

Reservations Table:

ReservationID|GuestID|RoomID|ReservationDate

    1|1|2|2024-10-05

    2|2|3|2024-10-06

### Expected Output:

GuestName|RoomType

    John Doe|Double

    Mary Jane|Suite

    James Smith|NULL
